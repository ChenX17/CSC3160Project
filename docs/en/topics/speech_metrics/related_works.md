For the MOS prediction, MOSNet[1] achieves superior performance compared with previous methods. The following literature improves the MOSNet from various perspectives. For example, [2] proposes a new model architecture to improve the MOSNet, [3][4][5] introduce additional features, and [6] improves the training strategy. 

Recently, self-supervised learning has achieved remarkable performance in speech, and some new works[7][8] leverage the SSL to improve the MOS prediction by loading a pre-trained model, which significantly improve the generalization ability of the system. More recent works[9][10] improve the MOS prediction system by utilizing domain information in the SSL pre-trained model.
