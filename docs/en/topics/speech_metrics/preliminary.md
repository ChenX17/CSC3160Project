## Background of VoiceMOS Challenge

"Human listening tests are the gold standard for evaluating synthesized speech. Objective measures of speech quality have low correlation with human ratings, and the generalization abilities of current data-driven quality prediction systems suffer significantly from domain mismatch. The VoiceMOS Challenge aims to encourage research in the area of automatic prediction of Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) for synthesized speech." --VoiceMOS Challenge 2022 Homepage
