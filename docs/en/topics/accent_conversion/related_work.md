Accent coversion methods can be divided into two categories, with reference and without reference. For the first category[1][2][3], reference(target speaker's speech) should be provided in the inference process. The requirement of reference utterances during inference limits the practical use, so there are some methods trying to convert the accent without reference speech. There are also two categories of reference-free methods, parallel-data-based and non-parallel-data-based. Parallel-data-based approaches[4][5] essentially apply voice conversion or text-to-speech to generate parallel data(speech with source speaker timbre, source accent, source content and  source speaker timbre, target accent, source content), firstly. Then the paired parallel data can be used as the input and output of the accent conversion module. Non-parallel-data-based approaches[6][7] try to decouple the content, speaker timbre and accent, and use the decoupled features reconstruct speech. In the inference stage, by controlling the accent, the conversion of the accent is realized
