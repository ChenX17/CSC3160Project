# Evaluation

## Metrics

There are three evaluation metrics for accent conversion system:

### Accentedness

For the accentedness rating metric, listeners were instructed to rate every sentence using 9-point Likert scales(sometimes 5-point scale).
- 1-no source accent, 
- 9-strong target accent.

### Acoustic quality and naturalness

Audio quality and naturalness are rated on a five-point scale in the MOS test, aiming to evaluate the clarity and human-likeness of the speech samples.

- 1-bad
- 2-poor
- 3-fair
- 4-good
- 5-excellent

### voice similarity. 

For the voice similarity metric, listeners were also asked to rate their confidence level on a 7-point scale(sometimes 5-point scale). They were instructed to only focus on voice similarity while ignoring others.

- 1-not at all confident that two samples are from the same speaker
- 7-extremely confident that two samples are from the same speaker

## How to Evaluate?

Typically, we using the aforementioned metrics to evaluate an accent conversion system. For each metric, we will collect rating scores of sentences from multiple listeners and use the averaged number as a final score of the system.
